# Heya I'm harsh.

A software developer.

Initially when I was getting started, I began learning front-end development, but it took me some time to realize that I'm not meant for it. Since then, Then I started doing backend development and  so far I've been loving it. Now, I'm looking for a job as a backend developer, I'm  proficient in Go, Python, and JavaScript. On top of it, I also possess a fair understanding of front-end development. I'd love to join a startup where I can leverage my skills to make a significant impact. If you're hiring, please feel free to reach out to me.
